# A Login Page Template
----
This is a simple repo composed of HTML and CSS. My humble attempt at making something aesthetically pleasing. I haven't added any further links to webpages since this is just a template. Feel free to integrate it into your project/website! Or just mess around with it. That's why I made it.

To change the background, replace the URL on `line 14` of `index.css` with the image adress of the desired background image. And of course, the other style sheets can be played around with as well.
